Employee View, Natalie Raptoplous

An app that can add/view/find employees. would include all personal info and things like hourly wages, monthly salary, etc. It would be useful for companies,
and I believe it is something I can make. Java has been the hardest language for me to learn, but I wanted to create something practical.

User Manual:
Imput the information as needed. The add button will add this information to a text file. The clear button will clear information. The exit button will exit you out of the program.
