* final code and demo to be added *

Employee View, Natalie Raptoplous

An app that can add/view/find employees. would include all personal info and things like hourly wages, monthly salary, etc. It would be useful for companies,
and I believe it is something I can make. Java has been the hardest language for me to learn, but I wanted to create something practical.

(Important) Draw initial UML class diagrams 

Plan and estimate of effort
Plan on working on it bit by bit while adding onto it as much as I can and adding GUI last.
